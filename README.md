<h1>Hey, I'm Mouhib</h1>
<h3>I'm interested in using and building technologies that solve problems</h3>

- I'm currently learning data science and machine learning. My aim now is to help collect biodata in order to train models to find patterns in why people develop certain diseases and how we can fight them. I'm new to this, but this will forever be a thing that sparks some joy in me.
